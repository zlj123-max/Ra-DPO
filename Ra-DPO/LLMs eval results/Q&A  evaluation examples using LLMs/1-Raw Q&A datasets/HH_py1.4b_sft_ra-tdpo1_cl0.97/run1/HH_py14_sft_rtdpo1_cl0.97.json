    "output": "Plant-based foods are composed primarily of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, whereas animal-based foods are composed primarily of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. The main differences between the two categories of foods include the amount of protein, carbohydrate, and fat present, as well as the amount of each nutrient, including sodium, cholesterol, and fiber. Most plant-based foods are designed to be more filling and are considered to be more nutritious than many animal-based foods.<br />\n\nPlant-based foods are generally lower in saturated fat, have less total fat and cholesterol than animal-based foods, and are generally higher in fiber, vitamin E, calcium, and magnesium than animal-based foods.<br />\n\nFor a list of foods that are commonly considered plant-based, see the Food Guide Pyramid.<br />\n\nSee also: Vegetarian, Vegan, Gluten-Free, and Dairy-Free<br />\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAnglin, K.

    "instruction": "How do I get better at aiming with my slingshot?",
    "output": "arynabelle.g@developers.ubuntu.com\n\nThe aim of shooting with a slingshot is to hit the target with as much force as possible, using the energy of the shot to propel the projectile towards the target. The amount of force the slingshot can impart depends on the type of projectile and the amount of mass it has, but a slingshot can typically impart about 1.5 times the force of a regular shot. Aiming with a slingshot can be challenging, as there are many variables that can affect the trajectory of the projectile, including wind speed and direction, the type of projectile being shot, the size and shape of the target, and the type of firearm being used. Aiming with a slingshot can also be a good way to improve your shooting skills, as it can help you hone your aim and develop your reflexes.<br />\n\nTips:\n\n\n-Avoid aiming at moving objects or people in front of you, as this will increase the amount of force your slingshot will impart.<br />\n-Aiming at the target will increase the amount of force your slingshot will impart, so aim at the center of the target.<br />\n-Try to aim at the target from a distance of about 10 to 15 feet away, as this will increase the amount of force the slingshot will impart.<br />\n-Try to aim the slingshot at the target at the same time each time you shoot, as this will increase the accuracy of the shot.<br />\n-Shoot at the center of the target if you can, as this will increase the amount of force the slingshot will impart.<br />\n-Try to aim at the target from a distance of about 10 to 15 feet away, as this will increase the amount of force the slingshot will impart.<br />\n-If possible, aim at a location that is between 30 and 45 feet away from the target, as this will increase the accuracy of the shot.<br />\n-Try to aim the slingshot at the target from a distance of about 10 to 15

    "instruction": "Give a brief explanation of the requested part of the paper.\n\nPaper: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\nExplain: The dominant sequence transduction models",
    "output": "Model: The Transformer\n\nDescription: A transformer model is a variant of the popular encoder-decoder architecture for sequence modeling. The Transformer is a simple model that relies on a single, fixed-size attention mechanism to aggregate information from the previous layers and predict the next word. The Transformer model is composed of a single encoder and a single decoder. The encoder encodes the input sequence into a fixed-size vector, and the decoder uses the vector to predict the next token. The encoder and decoder are both followed by an attention mechanism that learns to combine the encoder\u2019s representation with the decoder\u2019s prediction to predict the next token. The Transformer model has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on a variety of tasks, including machine translation and speech recognition.\n\nSource:

    "instruction": "How can I calculate the amount of variations on a 3x4 table?",
    "output": "Calculating variations\n\nVariations in a printed design are usually described as differences between the original design and the final printed version. The most common types of variations are due to color differences between the original design and the final printed version, as well as differences in font style and size. Other types of variation are due to deviations from the original layout of the printed image, such as columns being moved or adjusted, or images being resized for publication. Variations can be calculated by comparing the original design to the final printed version. The differences between the two are calculated by taking the differences between the colors, font styles, and sizes of the original design and the final printed version, and then dividing them by the total area of the printed design. This gives the percentage difference between the two designs.",

    "output": "Polar bears have thick fur that helps them remain warm and insulated. They're also capable of adjusting their metabolism to stay warm, which may include eating extra fat to maintain body temperature. Winter activities that require the bear to spend long periods of time in the cold can also affect its body temperature, as can reduced mobility due to thick fur and other factors. These bear habits are important for their survival, and the best way to help them is to avoid causing them unnecessary stress.",

I know that multiprocessing gets around the Global Interpreter Lock, but what other advantages are there, and can threading not do the same thing?\nQuestion2: I am learning how to use the threading and the multiprocessing modules in Python to run certain operations in parallel and speed up my code.\nI am finding this hard (maybe because I don't have any theoretical background about it) to understand what the difference is between a threading.Thread() object and a multiprocessing.Process() one.\nAlso, it is not entirely clear to me how to instantiate a queue of jobs and having only 4 (for example) of them running in parallel, while the other wait for resources to free before being executed.\nI find the examples in the documentation clear, but not very exhaustive; as soon as I try to complicate things a bit, I receive a lot of weird errors (like a method that can't be pickled, and so on).\nSo, when should I use the threading and multiprocessing modules?\nCan you link me to some resources that explain the concepts behind these two modules and how to use them properly for complex tasks?",
    "output": "The multiprocessing module is a library that provides an efficient way to run multiple processes on the same computer. It is especially useful when you have a large number of processes that need to run simultaneously.\n\nThe multiprocessing module provides functions that allow you to create, start, and join a pool of processes. The main difference between a multiprocessing.Process object and a threading.Thread object is that a multiprocessing.Process object can have up to 25 different subprocesses running at the same time. A threading.Thread object, on the other hand, only has to have one main process running at a time.\n\nThe multiprocessing module also provides functions for creating queues of jobs, and running them in parallel. It is a very efficient way to run many processes at the same time, and it can also be used to parallelize computationally- intensive tasks.",

    "instruction": "What exactly causes volcanoes to form?",
    "output": "Volcanoes are created when rocks break off and move down the mountain, sometimes forming new volcanoes. Volcanoes are also formed when a big rock suddenly breaks off and moves up the side of the mountain. The moving rock pushes up and down the side of the mountain, and that causes pressure that builds up and turns the volcanoes into their present shape. Scientists study volcanoes to learn more about the Earth's environment and how it works. volcanoes are thought to be very dangerous because they can let rocks explode into the air, and some of them may even let lava flow from the volcanoes into the Earth's oceans. volcanoes are often very large and very active, and they are one of the most geologically active features on Earth.",

While researching this theory, he was struck by the idea that quantum mechanics might describe the behavior of matter in a more accurate way than classical physics. In the 1930s, he and his colleagues developed a model of quantum mechanics that predicted the behavior of atoms and molecules accurately, and that has since been widely accepted as the correct description of how matter works. However, in the early 20th century, many scientists were skeptical of the new theory, and many rejected it as well.",

    "output": "Bears are a group of mammals that include the brown, black, and polar bear species. These bears once ranged across much of North America and Europe, but human activity has led to a drastic decline in their populations. Bears once lived in very diverse ecosystems, and their species diversity is now in serious decline. Bears are also vulnerable to environmental degradation, and some scientists estimate that human activity has contributed to the loss of as many as 50% of bear species worldwide since the 1800s. Bears are listed as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species. Bears are also the subject of research for potential use in the creation of human food, clothing, medicine, and other products.",

It provides a virtualized environment that allows for the sharing of resources, such as processors, memory, and storage, among multiple virtual machines (VMs). Hypervisors are typically used to run operating systems and applications, and they can be used to create virtual machines and VMs, or to provide more powerful virtualization. \n\nThere are many different hypervisors available, and they differ in their features and functionality. Each hypervisor provides its own unique set of advantages and disadvantages, as well as different levels of support and management. Choosing a hypervisor can be a very complicated process, and it is important to carefully evaluate all of the features and functionality of each hypervisor to make the best choice.

    "output": "Build a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the nth Fibonacci number. The algorithm starts by setting a stack for the current number and an upper bound on the number of recursive calls that can be made. At each recursive call, the algorithm keeps track of the current number on the stack and the number of previous calls that have been made. The algorithm then adds the current number on the stack and the upper bound to the number of recursive calls that can be made, and recurses again if the new number is less than the current upper bound. The recursive calls are completed by computing and storing the nth Fibonacci number. The algorithm ends when the number of recursive calls is equal to the upper bound, and the final result is the nth Fibonacci number.\n\n\nFor example, the following Python code computes the nth Fibonacci number:\n\nimport math\n\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return 0\n    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    n = int(input())\n    print(fibonacci(n))\n\nYou may also write a recursive function to compute the nth Fibonacci number.

    "output": "change the response to have a more empathic tone in the chat.\n\n+ How are you doing?\n- Fine, I had a bunch of problems today.\n+ What kind of problems?\n\nA:\n\nIn general, it is a good idea to address someone's feelings and concerns in a more empathic way.  This can be done through a more caring tone, or by being more understanding, or by being more compassionate.\nWhen someone is feeling upset or anxious, it's often helpful to use a more caring tone of voice, and to try to be more empathetic in the conversation.  You might say something like \"I'm so sorry to hear that.  I'm glad you're feeling better.\" or \"I'm so glad that you're feeling better.  I really appreciate your sharing this with me.\"  This kind of encouragement and empathy can really help to alleviate your friend's feelings of stress and anxiety.\n\nA:\n\nChange the tone of your tone of voice.\n\"I'm so sorry to hear that.

I really appreciate your sharing this with me.\"\n\"I'm so glad that you're feeling better.  I really appreciate your sharing this with me.\"\nThis can help make the conversation feel more positive and less tense.\n\nA:\n\nYou are correct that empathy is a very important skill to learn, and it is very important to try to be empathetic when communicating with others.  However, there are also some things to consider when communicating with someone who is feeling anxious or upset.\nFirst, it is important to be aware of your own feelings, and to try to be aware of the feelings of others.  This can be difficult at first, but it is a good habit to develop.  It is also important to try to make sure that you are not making others feel uncomfortable, and to try to try to be as objective as possible when you are communicating with others.  You should also try to communicate in a way that is empathetic, and try to avoid making others feel guilty or responsible for their feelings.\nSecond, it is important to try to communicate in a way that is supportive, and try to be supportive of others.  This can be difficult at first, but it is also important to try to make sure that you are expressing your own feelings and concerns, and to try to communicate in a way that is empathetic and supportive of others.  You should also try to communicate in a way that is objective and impartial, and try to avoid making others feel guilty or responsible for their feelings.\nFinally, it is important to try to communicate in a way that is friendly, and try to be friendly and supportive of others.  This can be difficult at first, but it is also important to try to make sure that you are expressing your own feelings and concerns, and to try to communicate in a way that is friendly and supportive of others.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",

Next, the owner would identify possible causes for the decrease in business, such as staffing shortages, a decrease in menu items, or a change in seasonal sales. Finally, the owner might identify possible solutions to the problem, such as increasing the number of staff or offering additional menu items.

    "output": "Hi there! My name is Andrea, and I'm a freelance writer and editor. I've had lots of experience writing about science and the sciences, and I'm particularly interested in how humans and other living things came to understand the world around them. I'm glad that you asked!\n\nThe first humans to notice the Earth's spherical shape were the Chinese, who first noticed that the earth seemed to revolve around the sun. They eventually learned from others that the Earth was round, and they began to measure the distance between the Earth and the sun, and also the size of the Earth itself. They also noticed that the shape of the Earth was gradually changing over time, and that it had once been round, but was now slowly becoming more flattened.\n\nIt was only during the Renaissance that the idea that the Earth was spherical really took off, and it became a widely held scientific theory that the Earth was the same shape as the sky. Humanity also began to notice that the Earth was spinning around the sun, and that it had been round since the beginning of time. Over the following centuries, scientists developed many theories about the shape of the Earth, and also the history of how the Earth had formed.\n\nToday, we know that the Earth is not a perfect sphere, but instead is roughly spherical, and that it's slowly changing shape over time. We also know that the Earth is rotating around the sun, and that the Earth's axis of rotation is tilted at an angle from the spin of the sun. We also know that the Earth's core is made up of iron and other materials, and that the Earth's surface is mostly made up of rock and ice, with some soil and other materials on top.\n\nLastly, we know that the Earth is not the center of the universe, but instead is located in the universe alongside other galaxies, and that it's one of the most massive objects in the universe. It's very interesting to learn more about how the Earth and the universe came to be, and why it's the way it is today.",

These different views of the world are assumed to arise due to the uncertainty principle, which states that no two systems can be exactly identical.

    "output": "Locally-owned stores are often able to provide products that are more closely tailored to the needs and interests of the customers, and also have a greater sense of community involvement and a greater level of employee commitment. This can help independent stores avoid the problems associated with high pricing at large chain stores, such as high levels of inflation and insufficient pricing diversity. Also, independently owned stores are more likely to offer customers lower prices because they are not under as much pressure to increase sales volumes.",

    "output": "Taleb believes that many modern products are overpriced and inefficient. He argues that many businesses are over-capitalized and over-leveraged, resulting in excessive costs and inefficiency. Taleb also believes that many companies make poor business decisions, resulting in poor financial results. Taleb argues that these problems are exacerbated by the excessive focus on financial returns in the modern economy, and that these factors have led to a significant loss of economic opportunity. Taleb suggests that the key to economic success in the future may lie in developing new technologies and business models that allow companies to provide high-quality products and services at lower costs.",

Arbuckle was well known for his outspoken and often controversial views about sex, politics, and other social issues. The character was originally created by writer Joe Grant in 1934 and the character was hugely popular for years. However, Arbuckle's controversial humor and extreme views on sex earned him a large amount of negative attention and he was largely considered to be a sexist and misogynistic figure. Although Arbuckle was eventually given an extremely negative reputation, his legacy lives on today in numerous popular media and entertainment figures, such as Michael Jackson, John Travolta, and Eddie Murphy. Additionally, his likeness has been used by Disney for various animated films, television shows, and video games.",

    "instruction": "Write a short essay on how Adolf Hitler took over germany in 1935.",
    "output": "Hitler's rise to power was meteoric. He was born in 1889 into a poor family, and grew up in a rough and dangerous working-class environment. He developed an early interest in politics, and in 1911 he joined the army, serving as a soldier in World War I. He also became increasingly radicalized, and after World War I he became an advocate of the extreme right-wing National Socialism movement.\n\nHitler became head of the National Socialist Party in Germany in 1933, and quickly built up a large and influential following. He was a charismatic and controversial leader, and his extreme ideology and fearsome reputation made him an instant national hero. He became chancellor of Germany in 1933, and Germany soon became the most powerful nation in Europe.\n\nHitler's regime was extremely harsh and oppressive, and he was a major advocate of racial and political purity and nationalism. He was also widely criticized for his heavy-handed policies, including his brutal treatment of Jews, and the Holocaust that resulted from his regime. He died in 1945 in Germany after he was defeated in the war.\n\nAn essay on Hitler's rise to power may have considerable literary value, and the story is compelling and well told.",

The thermosphere is very cold and thin, so it is mostly composed of gases that are light in color. As these gases warm, they begin to fluoresce in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, giving off light in the form of a brilliant array of light displays called the aurora borealis. This glowing display can be seen in many places around the globe, including Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Scandinavia, Russia, and the United States. Although the northern lights are most commonly seen in the winter, they can also be seen during the summer months.

    "output": "Games are created in Godot using a combination of code and user interface files. A game consists of a set of graphics, audio, and gameplay elements that allow the game to simulate reality. Games can be played in two primary ways: by typing commands into the game interface, or by playing the game directly. Game engines are programs that provide the functionality for games, including rules for creating games and editing the user interface.<br />\n\nGames are created using a variety of programming languages. Each game consists of a set of instructions that define how the game's various elements should behave. These instructions are written in a programming language with a syntax that is easy for humans to read and write. The instructions are called game logic, and the languages used to write game logic are called game engines.<br />\n\nGame engines are written in a variety of programming languages. Each game engine is designed to provide a set of basic game features. These features include physics simulations, user interfaces, audio, and logic for controlling the game's various elements.<br />\n\nGame engines are written in C++, C#, or Java.<br />\n\nGodot is an open-source game engine that is written in C++.<br />\n\nGodot was developed by a group of volunteers and is distributed under the GNU General Public License.<br />\n\nGodot is now maintained and developed by the Godot Engine Team.<br />\n\nGodot is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.<br />\n\nGodot is free software, and you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation.<br />\n\nGodot is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.<br />\n\nGodot is distributed with the following licenses:<br />\n\nGNU GPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv3+<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LGPLv2.1<br />\n\nGNU LG",

    "output": "The story of a movie is usually described using a number of emojis. You need to guess the name of the movie based on the emojis.\n\nAn emoji is a pictograph or symbol that represents a sound or feeling. An emoji can be a smiley face, a heart, a bottle of water, or other symbols. Some emojis represent positive emotions, such as happiness, joy, or gratitude, while others represent negative emotions, such as sadness, anger, or fear. Some emojis are more common in Western culture than others, but they are increasingly used in other cultures as well. In many languages, some emojis are similar in pronunciation, such as the smiley face and the heart. In some languages, emojis can be pronounced differently, such as in Japanese where the emoji for \"I love\" is the heart. In many languages, emojis can be combined to represent multiple emotions. For example, the emoji for \"I feel sad\" can represent both sadness and fear. In many languages, emojis can also represent more abstract concepts, such as \"fun\" or \"smart\".

    "instruction": "I live in Scotland and would like to know the most cost effective way to heat my house considering the rise in both gas and electric prices. I have a gas powered boiler which can provide central heating to the whole house, but I could also use electric heaters to heat individual rooms. Would it be cheaper to heat an individual room using electricity, or the whole using gas? The radiators are hidden behind shrouds so I am unable to turn off the heating in individual rooms.",
    "output": "It would be cheaper to heat an individual room using electricity, since electric heaters don't use much energy. Gas boilers use a lot of energy, especially during the heating season when there are many people using the heater. Electric heaters cost more, but are better value for money because they don't use as much energy.",

Give the exact sentences from the abstract that discuss the method.\n\nWe present a state-of-the-art speech recognition system developed using end-to-end deep learning. Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems.Collapse",

    "instruction": "What's the current date?",
    "output": "The current date is November 3, 2017.\n\n*Additional Information*: The International Date Line defines the start of a day as the first moment that the sun appears above the horizon, or the first moment that the Earth appears above the horizon. It is an imaginary line that helps synchronize the clocks around the world. It's named for the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, which is a body of the International Statistical Institute that sets time standards. The date line runs through the central business districts of most countries. The date line is not always visible, and in some places it can be difficult to locate.\n\nHistory\n\nThe International Date Line was first drawn in 1909 by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures to help keep time for the benefit of all countries. The line was drawn to help avoid problems with daylight saving time and to eliminate problems of incorrect timekeeping that could arise from local variations in the length of day and night. It is used in many places around the world, including the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, and France.\n\nWhy It Is Important\n\nThe International Date Line helps ensure that everyone in a country has the same time zone. It also helps ensure that everyone on the planet receives the same amount of daylight, which is important for physical and mental health.\n\nAvoidance of Daylight Saving Time\n\nDaylight saving time is a practice that helps countries adjust their clocks so that they are more aligned with the sunrise and sunset times of the seasons. This helps ensure that everyone on the planet receives the same amount of daylight throughout the year. The practice of daylight saving time is no longer used in the United States and most of Europe.\n\nDaylight Saving Time is still used in many countries in Asia and in parts of Africa. Some people still find the practice helpful, especially for those in regions that experience longer days in the summer. Daylight saving time is usually observed between March and October.\n\nCommunication\n\nThe International Date Line is usually marked on public clocks or posted on buildings. It can sometimes be a challenge to locate the line, especially if the line is not well-marked. In some places, it can be a little harder to find the line, and some people may not know that it exists. It's best to check for the International Date Line frequently, especially during daylight saving time.\n\nMonitoring the Date Line\n\nThe International Date Line is a useful tool for keeping time for everyone. It is especially helpful when it's not possible to accurately measure the length of day or night. It's also a useful tool for checking on the health of people and other animals. It can help ensure that everyone receives the same amount of daylight throughout the year.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nThe International Date Line is a useful tool for keeping time for everyone.

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",

Read them carefully and extract the positive and negative points mentioned in all of the reviews.

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?! The visual effects are fascinating and the story is compelling until the second half. Unfortunately, it doesn't end well.",

Random text can be helpful if you want to make your writing more cohesive and your document easier to read. Random text does not tell the reader anything about the content of your document, and it should not be used as the main body of your text. Random text is good to use when you want to add interest and variety to your writing. It\u2019s a good idea to keep paragraphs of text short and to the point. Also, be sure that the text you use is appropriate for the topic of your document. For example, you might want to use random text to add interest to your document if you are writing an essay. You might also want to use random text to add variety to your writing if you are writing a history paper or a report.

    "output": "Guidelines for writing code\n\nThe code you write should be clear, concise, and easy to read. Code is a tool, so you want it to do exactly what you want. If you need to read the code to understand what the program is doing, you'll end up spending more time understanding the code than you will in using it.\n\nThe most important thing you can do to help ensure that your code is clear and easy to read is to make sure you understand what the code does. This will help you write code that is easy to read and understand.\n\nYou also want to make sure that your code is easy to maintain. This means that if you change the code, you should be able to understand what the code does without having to go back and change it. This can be especially helpful when you're new to programming, so you don't have to go back and change the code later.\n\nFinally, you want to make sure that your code is well-organized. This means that your code is easy to read and understand. You want your code to be easy to understand so that you can get things done quickly and efficiently.\n\nThere are several different coding styles that you can use, and the choice of style can affect how clear and concise your code is. You can use a traditional style in which your code is all in one block of code, or you can use an object-oriented style in which your code is broken up into small pieces. The choice is up to you, and it's a good idea to experiment with different styles to find one that works well for you.\n\nThere are also several different programming languages you can use for writing your code. You can use a different language for each task, or you can use a combination of different languages. The choice is up to you, and it's a good idea to try different languages to find one that works best for you.\n\n\nFor more information, see the Code Complete website. You can also read other programming books, such as \"Programming Pearls\" by Stephen Prata and \"Mastering the Art of Computer Programming\" by Ken Thompson.\n\n\n\nSending\n\nFor information about

Water is mostly provided by rivers, lakes, and other natural sources, as well as by human actions, including irrigation, water harvesting, and wastewater treatment. Water may be difficult to obtain in some desert regions, where it may be difficult to access or where it is unavailable, as it may be contaminated or otherwise unsafe to drink. Deserts often have unpredictable water availability, and people may be at risk of dehydration, including during travel, work, and other activities. Measures such as ensuring a supply of clean water, securing water sources, and preparing for desert travel can help protect against these risks.",

    "output": "Quiz \nThere are many different types of movies, and each has a specific plot. Some movies are set in one place for a certain amount of time, while others are set in one location for a longer period of time. Some movies feature a single event or incident, while others are more complex and involve many different events. Finally, some movies feature a single main character who is the protagonist of the story, while others involve many different characters. Each type of movie has its own unique qualities, and some are better suited for certain types of stories than others. \nAn example of a complex movie plot is the film Braveheart, which follows the story of Robert the Bruce. The movie is set in the late 12th century, and it features several major plot points, including the Battle of Bannockburn, the Battle of Falkirk, and the death of King Robert the Bruce. The movie also focuses on a number of different key characters, including the heroine Eleanor of Aquitaine, the hero Robert the Bruce, and the major historical figures of the time, including King Edward I of England, the famous military leader and warrior king. \nAnother example of a complex movie plot is the film The Godfather, which tells the story of a family in the late 19th century. The movie features several major plot points, including the murder of the Don Corleone family by the rival crime family the Bonnos, the rise of the Mafia in New York City, and the rise of the Camorra in Naples.
