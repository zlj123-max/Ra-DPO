    "output": "Hi there! I'm a senior software engineer at Microsoft. I've worked on a variety of projects in the past, including some that involved multiple teams and stakeholders. I've learned a lot about how to collaborate with others, and how to avoid the pitfalls of getting too involved in a project. Here are some tips that I've found helpful:\n\n\n- Do your best to spend as much time as possible with the people on your team. This will help you understand what they're thinking and feeling, and make sure you're on the same page.\n\n- Stay focused on the goal of the project, and try to avoid getting too involved in the details. If you find yourself spending too much time on the minutiae of the project, you might find it easier to delegate or step back from the project.\n\n- Don't try to do too much yourself. If you're spending too much time on your own work, you might find it difficult to collaborate with others on the project.\n\n- Try to stay positive, and try to stay focused on the goal of the project.

    "output": "Hi there!\n\nThe S&W 1006 is a single-shot, single-action revolver. It fires one round per pull of the trigger, and it has a removable barrel with a fixed or adjustable rear sight. The S&W 1006 is typically chambered in .45 ACP, though it is also available in .32 ACP, and in .380 ACP.\n\nTo load the gun, you will want to remove the barrel and chamber the ammunition. Then, you will want to pull the trigger and pull back on the cylinder to chamber the cartridge. Then, you will want to pull the trigger again and pull back on the cylinder to chamber the next cartridge. Repeat the process until all the cartridges are in the gun. Once you're finished chambering all the cartridges, you will want to pull the trigger and chamber the last cartridge, and you will want to re-insert the barrel into the gun.",

    "instruction": "Give a brief explanation of the requested part of the paper.\n\nPaper: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\nExplain: The dominant sequence transduction models",

    "output": "Canada was colonized in 1841 by the British Empire. Canada's first permanent settler, John Graves Simcoe, was a lawyer and a politician who had previously lived in the United States. He arrived in Canada with a small group of settlers from the United States, and set up a settlement in the Canadian province of Upper Canada (present-day Ontario). Simcoe divided the province into two administrative regions, Upper Canada and Lower Canada, and set about expanding the colony. The colony grew in size and importance, with Simcoe establishing the province of Ontario and Canada's first capital, Ottawa.\n\nIn 1841, Simcoe invited the United States to join Canada's union, and the two countries established the Province of Canada in 1842. The United States formally became a province of Canada in 1841, and the union became a federal union in 1867.",

Medium-rare steaks are medium in both color and texture, and should have a firm, tender texture. They should be pink in the center and should not be pink on the edges. If the steak is overcooked, it will be tough and chewy. Steaks should be taken from the center of the bone to the edge of the meat. To help ensure a juicy, tender steak, you should use a precise cooking method. The most common method is to place the steak on a hot grill, or on a hot pan, and to cook it slowly for several minutes, or until the steak is medium-rare. You can also cook steaks in the oven, if you want to cook them to a more medium-rare internal temperature. If you want to cook the steak to medium-well, you should cook the steak on a medium-high heat for several minutes. If you want to cook the steak to medium, you should cook it for about 7 minutes. If you want to cook the steak to medium-well, you should cook it for about 10 minutes.",

This can be very difficult to do, especially if you have a lot of other things going on in your life. Habits are formed when we consistently do something for a long time without thinking about it too much. Habit formation is very similar to that of a new behavior, so you can use the same principles. Here are some tips for forming a new habit:\n\n1. Make a list of the things you want to do.\n\n2. Write down the steps you need to do.\n\n3. Write down the time you need to do them.\n\n4.

    "output": "Hi there! Thanks for your question! The reason you can't see the stars in the city is because the city is much higher up in the sky, so there are fewer stars in the sky above the city. However, the stars are much closer to us in the sky, so they're much more visible. The reason you can see the stars in the countryside is because the stars are much farther away from us in the sky, so they're more difficult to see. In order to see the stars in the city, you would have to go up quite high in the sky in order to see them. However, the stars are much closer to us in the sky, so they're much easier to see. The best way to see the stars in the city is to go to a big city like New York or Los Angeles, where there are a lot of people, and they're very bright. The best way to see the stars in the countryside is to go to a place like the desert, where there aren't many people, and there aren't many bright stars in the sky. The stars are very far away from us in the sky, so they're very difficult to see.",

    "output": "Let's start with the basics. A nice handwriting is one that is clean, clear, and legible. Think of it as a way to present yourself as an educated individual and as someone who is conscious of the impact their writing has on others. \nTo improve your handwriting, first of all, take a moment to relax. Inhale deeply, and slowly exhale. Focus on the breath and the muscles in your arms and shoulders. Think about the feeling of your breath as it enters and leaves your body, and focus on how it feels. \nNext, practice writing slowly and carefully. Take a few minutes to write a short sentence or two, and then practice writing more slowly and more carefully. When you are finished, review your work and try to practice writing more slowly and carefully. \nIn addition, practice writing in a comfortable position. Sit up straight, with your shoulders relaxed and your arms and hands relaxed, and look at your writing. You should feel your handwriting flow from your shoulders and down to your wrists. If you find it difficult to write in a relaxed manner, try holding your pen in your hand as you write, or placing it on your desk and writing in a comfortable position. \nFinally, practice writing with a pen that has a smooth nib. If you are not able to write smoothly with a pen that has a smooth nib, try practicing writing with a ballpoint pen or a fountain pen. These pens have a smooth nib that is less likely to cause any irritation or soreness in your hands. \nOnce you are able to write with a pen that has a smooth nib, try practicing writing in a comfortable position. You should feel your writing flow from your shoulders and down to your wrists. If you find it difficult to write in a comfortable position, try holding your pen in your hand as you write, or placing it on your desk and writing in a comfortable position. \nYou should also practice writing in a relaxed manner.

ChatGPT will also enable users to collaborate on projects and discuss interesting topics in a way that was previously only possible in groups. In addition to ChatGPT, Kugel is also developing a chat app called ChatGPT.io, which will offer a similar conversational experience.",

    "output": "We can\u2019t answer your question with a formula, but we can give you some hints. The distribution of primes is not random, since it\u2019s not uniform. There are many different ways to generate primes, but they all give the same distribution. For example, the Chinese remainder theorem gives us a formula that can be used to generate all primes.\n\n\nThere are also many different algorithms that can be used to generate all primes. One method is to use a greedy algorithm. This method generates all primes until it runs out of space. Another method is to use a block-procedural algorithm. This algorithm generates all primes until it runs out of space. Both of these methods give the same distribution of primes.\n\nAnother way to generate all primes is to use an iterative algorithm. This method generates all primes until it runs out of space. An iterative algorithm is much more efficient than a greedy algorithm. However, an iterative algorithm is much slower, so it\u2019s not a good choice for generating all primes.",

    "output": "Hi there! Thanks for writing!\n\nFirst, I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble with Godot Engine 4.x. It's been a long time since I've played with it, but I believe you should be able to find the Godot Engine 4 documentation on the Godot wiki.\n\nSecond, the Godot Engine 4 first person controller script is written in the same language as the Godot Engine 3 script. So you can use the same basic principles in Godot Engine 4 as you did in Godot Engine 3. It's just a matter of adapting the code to work with the new engine. The Godot Engine 3 first person controller script is available on the Godot wiki, and I believe you can find the Godot Engine 3 documentation on the Godot wiki as well.\n\nI hope this helps!",

    "instruction": "What if the Maya civilization had never mysteriously collapsed?",
    "output": "A:\n\nThis is a very hard question, and a very complex one.\nThe Maya were a highly developed civilization that existed for at least three thousand years. They were a major power in Mesoamerica, and probably the world. They were a cultural and intellectual powerhouse. They invented many important technologies, such as writing, architecture, astronomy, and mathematics.\nTheir collapse was a major tragedy for the Maya, and has left a massive archaeological legacy. Their civilization collapsed in the 8th century, and they were largely wiped out by the Spanish conquistadors. \nThere are many theories about the causes of the Maya collapse, but most of them focus on the interaction between the environment and the Maya themselves. There are several theories about why the Maya collapsed, but none of them are very clear. The most commonly accepted theory is that the Maya were hit by an extremely harsh climate and a severe drought. They may have also been hit by a massive volcanic eruption, which may have caused them to collapse. \nThere are many other theories about the causes of the Maya collapse, including the impact of other civilizations, such as the Aztecs, or the impact of European colonization. But none of these theories are very clear, and the causes of the Maya collapse are still a mystery. \nThe Maya were a highly advanced civilization, and their collapse was a huge tragedy for them. The Maya civilization had an enormous cultural and intellectual legacy, and they deserve a lot of respect for their accomplishments. Their collapse is one of the great tragedies in Maya history.",

Using the data from the video, the app reconstructs a 3d avatar which is shaped accurately by the measurements of the user. The avatar has almost the same face and hairstyle as the user. In the app there are also 3D clothes that can be 'tried on' by the avatar, and the avatar can also do different poses. Suitable outfits are recommended based on the measurements of the avatar (e.g. height, length of limbs). Similar items from different fashion brands are suggested to the user based on their previous choice of fashion items.",

It's a 3D technology that allows the user to interact with the virtual world and the real world through a single display.

By looking around in the virtual world, you can also interact with the 3D objects and the virtual world.\n\n\nIn the app, the user can choose their avatar to be the main character of the app, and they can also choose their outfit. There are also 3D clothes that can be 'tried on' by the avatar, and the avatar can also do different poses. Suitable outfits are recommended based on the measurements of the avatar (e.g. height, length of limbs).\n\n\nBased on the user's measurements, the app creates a 3D model of the avatar and then uses that model to create a virtual 3D model of the user's face. The avatar's face can also be moved in 3D space, and based on the movement of the avatar's face, the app can also create a virtual 3D model of the user's body. This app is called 3D clothing.\n\n\nThe 3D clothing can also be customized based on the measurements of the avatar. For instance, the user can choose their hairstyle. The app can also suggest different clothing and accessories based on the user's measurements. For instance, the user can choose their shoes based on their height and length of limbs.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",

    "output": "Hi there!\n\nThe @ character in Python is a special character that means \"hash mark\" or \"underscore\". It is used to indicate a variable or function name.\n\nFor example, the @ variable means the variable is called \"hashmark\" or \"underscore\".\n\nYou can use the @ character in place of any other character to mark a variable or function name. For example, this code:\n\n>>> @def my_fun(x): print(x)\n>>> my_fun(42)\n42\n>>>\n\nwill output \"def my_fun(x): print(x)\" instead of just \"my_fun(42)\"\n\nYou can use the @ character in place of any other character to mark a variable or function name. For example, this code:\n\n>>> @def my_fun(x): print(x)\n>>> my_fun(42)\n>>>\n\nwill output \"def my_fun(x): print(x)\" instead of just \"my_fun(42)\"\n\nYou can also use the @ character to create a function definition. For example, this code:\n\n>>> @def my_fun(x): print(x)\n>>> my_fun(42)\n>>>\n\nwill output \"def my_fun(x): print(x)\" instead of just \"my_fun(42)\"\n\nYou can also use the @ character to create a function definition.

For example, it's often easier for people from a different culture to understand and communicate with people from their own culture than it is for people from their own culture to understand and communicate with people from other cultures. It's also common for people to have different views of what constitutes appropriate communication styles. For example, it's often easier for people from different cultures to understand and communicate with each other in situations that don't involve arguing, than it is for people from their own culture to understand and communicate with each other in situations that involve arguing.\n\nSo, the answer to your question is that it's very common for people from different cultures to have different communication styles, and for those different styles to lead to differences in how people interact with one another.

Sleeping for only one night with a dim light, such as a TV set with the sound off, raised the blood sugar and heart rate of the young people during the sleep lab experiment. An elevated heart rate at night has been shown in prior studies to be a risk factor for future heart disease and early death, while higher blood sugar levels are a sign of insulin resistance, which can ultimately lead to type 2 diabetes.",

However, they were not a traditional band. The Beatles were not formed as a group. Rather, they were a collection of individuals who had formed a band in a more or less ad hoc fashion. The Beatles formed in 1962, with John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and quickly became one of the most successful groups of the 1960s and 1970s. Over the next few years, they released several more successful albums and singles, and also released several albums featuring covers of other artists' songs. However, they were not a traditional band. The Beatles were not formed as a group.",

    "output": "Hi there!\n\nAn egg can only be cooked using sunlight, in a place that is in the sun. There are many places in our solar system where sunlight can reach the egg: Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. In these places, sunlight is strong enough to heat the egg to a temperature of about 75 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nIn order for an egg to cook properly, it must be kept in a warm place, such as a bowl of water, and not be moved around too much. The egg should also be protected from the cold and bright sunlight. An egg that is not protected from the light may be damaged by it, or even cracked.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about cooking eggs, I recommend visiting the website for the National Center for Home Economics. They have many helpful videos on how to cook eggs, and also offer a lot of other information about home economics.",

    "output": "Hi there!\n\nCactus is a succulent plant that grows in a wide variety of soils. The type of soil you use will largely affect the growth of the cactus, but also the taste and appearance of the plant. Cactus are very thirsty plants, so they generally prefer well-drained soils with a high pH. They are also very sensitive to soil pH, and cactus can be very sensitive to changes in pH. Some cactus can also be sensitive to low water availability, so it\u2019s important to have adequate watering to maintain a healthy plant.\n\nCactus are very drought-tolerant plants, so cactus are often grown in areas with little rainfall, and they also need plenty of water to stay healthy. Cactus are also fairly drought-tolerant plants, so they can be grown in areas that are very dry or very hot. Cactus can also be grown in areas with a lot of sun, and they can also tolerate some shade. Cactus are very good plants to grow in areas with a lot of wind, because cactus are wind-tolerant plants. Cactus are also very good plants to grow in areas with a lot of humidity, because cactus are also very drought-tolerant plants.\n\nThe ideal soil for cactus is one that has a high pH and high levels of organic matter. This will allow the cactus to grow well and be able to take in water and nutrients. Cactus are also very sensitive to soil pH, so you want to make sure that the soil you use has a high pH. Cactus can also be very sensitive to soil pH, so you want to make sure that the soil you use has a high pH. Cactus are also very sensitive to low water availability, so you want to make sure that the soil you use has adequate water. Cactus are also very sensitive to low levels of light, so you want to make sure that the soil you use has adequate light to ensure that the plant is healthy. Cactus are also very sensitive to low levels of humidity, so you want to make sure that the soil you use has enough humidity to ensure that the plant is healthy.",

Can you tell me how to fix it?|assistant|\n\n|user|Sure. The problem is that you're trying to access an element of a table that doesn't exist. This is a common beginner error, and can lead to lots of problems. Here's what you should do: \n\n- First, make sure you're actually running the code correctly. Double check that you've included all the required code and that your database schema is correct.\n- Next, check to see if the table exists at all. You can do this by running the following query: \n\nselect * from information_schema.tables where table_name = 'my_table';\n\n- If the table doesn't exist, then you should probably start from the beginning, and add the missing tables and columns. You can also look at other common beginner errors, such as not including the correct column names, and not including the correct data types. You can also try to correct the database schema by adding a primary key to the table, and adding a unique constraint to the table to make sure that it doesn't have duplicates.\n- Next, check to make sure that you've included the proper table name in your code. You can do this by running the following query: \n\nselect table_schema, table_name from information_schema.tables where table_name = 'my_table';\n\n- If the table doesn't exist, then it probably doesn't exist. You can correct this by adding a new table, or by changing the existing table's name.\n- Next, check to make sure that you've included the proper column names in your code. You can do this by running the following query: \n\nselect column_name, column_type from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'my_table';\n\n- If the column doesn't exist, then it probably doesn't exist. You can correct this by adding a new column, or by changing the existing column's name.\n- Next, check to make sure that you've included the correct data types in your code. You can do this by running the following query: \n\nselect type_name, data_type from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'my_table';\n\n- If the column doesn't exist, then it probably doesn't exist. You can correct this by adding a new column, or by changing the existing column's name.\n- Next, check to make sure that you've included the correct table name in your code.

I'm here to tell you why I think this is a good idea. \r\n\nFirst, loud music is a lot of noise, and the louder the music, the more noise it creates. This creates a lot of stress for the ears, and can cause hearing loss. It also makes it hard for children to hear speech. \r\n\nSecond, the more noise a child experiences, the harder it is to concentrate, and the harder it is to learn. \r\n\nThird, loud music has a lot of negative effects on the environment. Loud music reduces the amount of money spent on music equipment, and also causes people to be more likely to spend money on other things, like alcohol, which can also have negative effects on the environment.",

    "instruction": "How do I build a PC?",
    "output": "Hi there!\n\nThe best way to learn how to build a PC is to start with a simple project, like building a basic computer from scratch. That way, you can build a working PC without having to worry about things like installing drivers and software, or figuring out how to configure your computer.\n\nTo build a computer, you'll need a few items, like a computer, a monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse. If you have a desktop computer, you can usually build a computer from those materials. If you're building a laptop, you'll need a computer chassis, a power supply, and a battery. You can also build a computer from scratch from parts you already have, like a motherboard, a CPU, RAM, hard drives, and a power supply.\n\nOnce you've built a computer, you'll need to install all the hardware and software it needs to run, and you'll need to configure it to work as you want it to. You can do all of that manually, or you can use a computer program like Windows or Linux to help you with the setup. If you use a computer program, you'll need to make sure that your computer is set up correctly so that it can run programs you've installed. You can also use a computer program to help you configure your computer so that it works the way you want it to. \n\n\nIf you want to learn more about building a computer, you can read our article about building a computer. You can also check out our list of computer guides, or you can ask us how to use our computer guides for help. Good luck!",

The algorithm is as follows:\n\nSplit the array in two:\n\nSort each part using the Timsort algorithm, and merge the two sorted arrays into a new sorted array.\n\nThis algorithm works very well, and it is very fast.\n\nHere is a code example:\n\nSort an array using the Timsort algorithm:\n\n\nint size = array.length / 2;\n\nint start = 0;\nint end = size - 1;\n\nwhile (start <= end) {\n    int mid = (start + end) / 2;\n    array[mid] = array[start];\n    array[mid + 1] = array[end];\n    start = mid + 2;\n}\n\nMerge the two sorted arrays:\n\n\nint start = 0;\nint end = size - 1;\n\nwhile (start <= end) {\n    int mid = (start + end) / 2;\n    if (array[mid] > array[start]) {\n        array[mid] = array[start];\n    }\n    else {\n        array[mid + 1] = array[end];\n    }\n    start = mid + 2;\n}\n\nThis algorithm is very fast, and it is very efficient. The algorithm is very memory efficient, and it runs very fast.\n\nHere is a code example:\n\n\nint size = array.length / 2;\n\nint start = 0;\nint end = size - 1;\n\nwhile (start <= end) {\n    int mid = (start + end) / 2;\n    array[mid] = array[start];\n    array[mid + 1] = array[end];\n    start = mid + 2;\n}\n\nThis algorithm is very efficient, and it is very memory efficient. It is very fast, and it runs very fast.\n\nHere is an example with the Lean 4 compiler:\n\n\nint size = array.length / 2;\n\nint start = 0;\nint end = size - 1;\n\nwhile (start <= end) {\n    int mid = (start + end) / 2;\n    array[mid] = array[start];\n    array[mid + 1] = array[end];\n    start = mid + 2;\n}\n\nThis algorithm is very efficient, and it is very memory efficient.

Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems.Collapse",

This network is trained with a large amount of diverse data, including millions of sentences and millions of hours of human-labeled speech. Deep Speech also uses multiple GPUs to speed up training and performance. It achieves 16.0% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00.Deep Speech is publicly available at https://github.com/Microsoft/deep-speech.

We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation.

Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.\nWe don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)\nObviously telling him he is ruining my trip with his negative energy isn't the best way to approach this.\nAny advice for the best approach so we can split amicably?

    "instruction": "Summarize the article you have been given in a brief manner.\n\nMathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",

Read them carefully and extract the positive and negative points mentioned in all of the reviews. Then, make a list of these points and summarize them as positive points and negative points.\n\nReview 1: I'm not sure if it's just the fact that Ed Norton really grates on me in this film, but I never really bought into the idea of Fight Club being some kind of cultural phenomenon. Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?! The visual effects are fascinating and the story is compelling until the second half. Unfortunately, it doesn't end well.",
